Language and Tools:
Programming Language
C++ is the primary programming language used in the development of the ChatNest project. The
selection of C++ was based on its effectiveness in managing data structures, efficiency, and
versatility. It offers the framework for creating a powerful command-line chat program that features
buddy management, messaging, and user authentication.
Development Tools
Code Editor
Coding and development require a code editor. Standard code editors like Visual Studio Code, Visual
C++, and Code::Blocks can be used with ChatNest. To speed up the development process, these
editors come with capabilities like project management, debugging, and code highlighting.
Compiler
The source code must be translated into executable applications using a C++ compiler. You can use
one of the following well-known C++ compilers to compile ChatNest:
• MinGW: A low-key Windows native application development environment.
• GCC is a popular compiler package that supports a number of different programming
languages.
Command/Terminal Prompt
Because ChatNest is a command-line application, user contact takes place via the terminal or
command prompt. It is where users log in, send messages, handle their friend list, and carry out other
program functions. ChatNest can be run from any regular terminal or command prompt.
