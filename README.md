Data Structures Used

Map (std::map)
Usage:
• User account administration
• User verification
• Connecting passwords to usernames
Description:
Information about user accounts is stored in maps. Every user has an individual username, and the
map data structure maps each user's password to it. This makes user authentication and registration
safe and effective.
Vector (std::vector)
Usage:
• Taking care of buddy lists
• Participants in group chats
• Storage of messages
Description:
In ChatNest, vectors are used to maintain buddy lists, group chat participants, and message histories.
Through vector-based structures, users can add, remove, and interact with these lists, offering
flexibility and administration simplicity.
Arrays (char arrays)
Usage:
• Message transmission and storage
Description:
In ChatNest, text messages are stored and sent using arrays of characters. The array's elements each
represent a character in a message, allowing text-based communication to occur.
